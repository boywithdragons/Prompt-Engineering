# About the Project
This repository contains a copy of the [__Bing Copilot for Beginners: Enhancing Productivity with AI__](https://www.coursera.org/projects/bing-copilot-for-beginners-enhancing-productivity-with-ai) Coursera project, which I have completed. I have uploaded it here to showcase my work and refer to it for future learning.
