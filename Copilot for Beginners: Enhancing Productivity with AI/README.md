# About the Project
This repository contains a copy of the [__Bing Copilot for Beginners: Enhancing Productivity with AI__](https://www.coursera.org/projects/bing-copilot-for-beginners-enhancing-productivity-with-ai) Coursera project, which I have completed. I have uploaded it here to showcase my work and refer to it for future learning.

Anyone interested can view the [__completion certificate__](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/Q0SBCMMQ9KYR). Additionally, you can visit my [__LinkedIn__](www.linkedin.com/in/boywithdragons) profile to explore more of my projects and work.


## Tools and Techniques Used
- __Microsoft Copilot__ is an advanced AI-powered assistant integrated across Microsoft products.
- __One-shot prompting:__ Involves providing some contextual information for the AI to refine and build upon existing data, resulting in more specific and relevant outputs.
- __Zero-shot prompting:__ A technique where information is requested directly without prior context, useful for generating factual responses, such as market trends. The AI generates a response based on its pre-trained Knowledge.
  
    ### How it works
    
    Insted of guilding the AI specific examples as in few-shot prompting, xero-shot prompting relies on the AI's ability to understand and process natural language to generate responses independently.
    
    ### When to use Zero-shot Prompting?

    - When seeking __general knowledge or factual responses__(e.g., market trends, industry insights).
    - When we __don't have specific examples to provide__.
    - For __quick, broad research__ before refining the prompt with more details.
